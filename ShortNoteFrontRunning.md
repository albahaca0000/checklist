### **Auditor's Workflow for Identifying Front-Running Vulnerabilities**

#### **1. Read and Understand the Code**
- **Focus Areas:** Functions that involve funds, sensitive state updates, swaps, auctions, or external calls.
- Look for **get-or-create patterns**, bid functions, or sequential state changes that attackers could exploit.

#### **2. Analyze Mempool Exposure**
- Determine what information (e.g., bid amounts, swaps, or approvals) is visible in the mempool before execution.
- Identify if any state transitions depend on public data that attackers can see before mining.

#### **3. Simulate Potential Attacks**
- Think like an attacker. Identify ways to:
  - Submit higher gas fees to prioritize their transaction.
  - Exploit visible data to preempt legitimate users.
- Tools like **Ganache** or **Tenderly** can simulate attacks for testing.

#### **4. Test for Race Conditions**
- Look for conditions where two or more users can interact with the same function at the same time, creating conflicts.
- Test edge cases by submitting conflicting transactions with different gas fees and observe execution order impacts.

#### **5. Check Mitigation Mechanisms**
- **Commit-Reveal Patterns:** Ensure sensitive data (e.g., bids, votes) are hashed during the commit phase and only revealed later.
- **Locks and Cooldowns:** Verify if functions enforce time delays or reentrancy guards to prevent rapid consecutive actions.
- **User-Specific States:** Ensure actions are tied to individual users to isolate effects (e.g., balances tracked per user).
- **Thresholds and Conditions:** Look for minimum bid amounts or reservation mechanisms to prevent dust or invalid entries.

#### **6. Review State Transition Logic**
- Examine how the contract handles state updates when multiple transactions compete for the same resource.
- Verify refunds or rollbacks are properly implemented to avoid inconsistencies.

#### **7. Test with Automated Tools**
- Use tools like **Slither**, **MythX**, or **Echidna** to detect potential vulnerabilities automatically.
- Review flagged issues for relevance to front-running attacks.

#### **8. Document Findings**
- Clearly outline the affected function, attack vector, and the potential impact.
- Suggest mitigations like commit-reveal schemes, locks, or better state handling.

By systematically following these steps, auditors can efficiently identify, simulate, and document front-running vulnerabilities in smart contracts.
